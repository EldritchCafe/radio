        <p class="txtbig">This radio is powered by the publications made on the social media platform <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>. The goal behind it is to make a place to discover music outside your usual bubble. Hope you enjoy it!</p>

        <h2>Where does the music come from?</h2>
        <p>The app gets all the public publications that contain a media link and a music hashtag (you can configure it in the Settings). We support only Youtube links for now, but more platforms are planned in the future.<br>
        We don’t own the musics rights so the songs are played on the original platform player.</p>
        <h2>How can I get my song be played on the radio?</h2>
        <p>You have to make a public toot containing one of the hashtags configured on the app and a Youtube link.</p>
        <h2>Can I use the radio on my phone?</h2>
        <p>It’s a webapp so it should be working, however since the Youtube Player allows us to play a song only when you’re on the web and stops when the screen turns off or when you’re on another app, it’s kind of unusable.<br>
        It’s kind of shitty but as long Youtube has this behavior we don’t see a way to make a great experience for the radio on mobile devices.</p>
        <h2>How can I contact you? I’ve detected a problem, have an idea, or a kind message.</h2>
